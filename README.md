### Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to build a predictive model to estimate the duration of movie rentals. By leveraging historical rental data, we aim to create a model that can predict how long a movie will be rented based on various features.

### Data source 

Rental Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the rental_info.csv file. This dataset includes detailed information about different rentals, such as rental dates, movie genres, customer details, and rental durations.
